2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-2#1 Warning
Invalid primary clock source pin  
A primary clock system_i/util_ds_buf_3/U0/BUFG_O[0] is created on an inappropriate pin system_i/util_ds_buf_3/U0/BUFG_O[0]. It is recommended to create a primary clock only on a proper clock source (input port or primitive output pin with no timing arc)
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-4#1 Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock system_i/SignalGenerator/clk_wiz_0/inst/clk_in1 is defined downstream of clock adc_clk and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-4#2 Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock system_i/SignalGenerator/clk_wiz_2/inst/clk_in1 is defined downstream of clock adc_clk and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-4#3 Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock system_i/util_ds_buf_3/U0/BUFG_O[0] is defined downstream of clock adc_clk and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#1 Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_fpga_0 and clk_out1_system_clk_wiz_2_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_fpga_0] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_system_clk_wiz_2_0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#2 Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_fpga_0 and system_i/util_ds_buf_3/U0/BUFG_O[0] are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_fpga_0] -to [get_clocks system_i/util_ds_buf_3/U0/BUFG_O[0]]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#1 Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks clk_fpga_0 and clk_out1_system_clk_wiz_2_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_fpga_0] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_system_clk_wiz_2_0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#2 Warning

To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_fpga_0] -to [get_clocks system_i/util_ds_buf_3/U0/BUFG_O[0]]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -3.454 ns between system_i/axi_gpio_1/U0/gpio_core_1/Not_Dual.gpio_Data_Out_reg[1]/C (clocked by clk_fpga_0) and system_i/SignalGenerator/carredephase180max_0/inst/carredephase180max_struct/mux1/pipe_44_22_reg[0][0]/D (clocked by clk_out1_system_clk_wiz_2_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>
